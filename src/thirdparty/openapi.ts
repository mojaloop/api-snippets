                 * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                 * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in

                 * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                 * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                 * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                 * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                 * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                 * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                 * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

             * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
             * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
             * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
             * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
             * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
             * PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
             * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
             * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
             * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
             * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
             * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
             * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
             * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
             * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
             * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
             * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
             * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
             * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
             * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
             * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
             * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
             * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
             * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
             * by the PartyIdentifier.
             * - CONSENT - TBD

             * Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.
             * - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
             * Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
             * The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
             * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
             * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
             * international prefix.
             * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
             * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
             * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
             * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
             * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
             * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
             * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
             * PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
             * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
             * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
             * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
             * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
             * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
             * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
             * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
             * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
             * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
             * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
             * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
             * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
             * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
             * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
             * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
             * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
             * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
             * by the PartyIdentifier.
             * - CONSENT - TBD
             * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - TBD

         * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
         * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
         * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
         * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
         * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
         * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

         * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
         * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
         * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
         * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
         * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
         * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
         * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

           * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
           * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
           * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
           * characters and should be entered without whitespace.

           * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
           * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the

         * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
         * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
         * international prefix.
         * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
         * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
         * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
         * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
         * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
         * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
         * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
         * PartySubIdOrType element.
         * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
         * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
         * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number

         * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
         * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
         * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
         * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
         * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
         * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
         * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
         * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
         * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
         * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
         * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
         * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
         * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
         * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
         * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
         * by the PartyIdentifier.
