           * Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
           * The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
           * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
           * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
           * international prefix.
           * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
           * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
           * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
           * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
           * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
           * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
           * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
           * PartySubIdOrType element.
           * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
           * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
           * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
           * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
           * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
           * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
           * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
           * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
           * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
           * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
           * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
           * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
           * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
           * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
           * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
           * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
           * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
           * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
           * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
           * by the PartyIdentifier.
           * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
           * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
           * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
           * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
           * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
           * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
           * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
           * specific access to a given account.

                   * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
                   * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                   * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                   * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                   * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                   * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                   * PartySubIdOrType element.
                   * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                   * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                   * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                   * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                   * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                   * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                   * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                   * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                   * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                   * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                   * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                   * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                   * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                   * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                   * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                   * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                   * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                   * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                   * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                   * by the PartyIdentifier.
                   * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
                   * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
                   * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
                   * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
                   * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
                   * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
                   * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
                   * specific access to a given account.

                   * - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
                   * Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
                   * The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
                   * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
                   * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
                   * international prefix.
                   * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
                   * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
                   * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                   * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                   * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                   * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                   * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                   * PartySubIdOrType element.
                   * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                   * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                   * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                   * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                   * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                   * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                   * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                   * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                   * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                   * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                   * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                   * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                   * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                   * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                   * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                   * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                   * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                   * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                   * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                   * by the PartyIdentifier.
                   * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
                   * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
                   * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
                   * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
                   * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
                   * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
                   * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
                   * specific access to a given account.
                   *

                 * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                 * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                 * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                 * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                 * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                 * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                 * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                 * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,

                 * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                 * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                 * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                 * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                 * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                 * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                 * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                 * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                 * by the PartyIdentifier.
                 * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
                 * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
                 * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
                 * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
                 * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
                 * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
                 * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for

                 * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                 * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                 * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                 * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                 * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                 * PartySubIdOrType element.
                 * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                 * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                 * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                 * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                 * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                 * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                 * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                 * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                 * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                 * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                 * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                 * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                 * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                 * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                 * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                 * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                 * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                 * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                 * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                 * by the PartyIdentifier.
                 * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
                 * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
                 * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
                 * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
                 * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
                 * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
                 * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for

             * Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
             * The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
             * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
             * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
             * international prefix.
             * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
             * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
             * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
             * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
             * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
             * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
             * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
             * PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
             * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
             * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
             * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
             * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
             * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
             * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
             * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
             * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
             * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
             * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
             * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
             * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
             * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
             * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
             * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
             * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
             * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
             * by the PartyIdentifier.
             * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
             * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
             * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
             * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
             * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
             * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
             * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
             * specific access to a given account.

               * Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
               * The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
               * [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
               * Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
               * international prefix.
               * - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
               * participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
               * [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
               * - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
               * Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
               * number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
               * the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
               * PartySubIdOrType element.
               * - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
               * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
               * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
               * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
               * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
               * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
               * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
               * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
               * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
               * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
               * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
               * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
               * participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
               * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
               * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
               * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
               * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
               * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
               * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
               * by the PartyIdentifier.
               * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
               * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
               * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
               * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
               * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
               * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
               * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for

             * is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
             * format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
             * in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
             * - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
             * specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
             * For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
             * use the PartySubIdOrType element.
             * - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
             * reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
             * as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
             * - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a

             * characters and should be entered without whitespace.
             * - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
             * created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
             * Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
             * The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
             * PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
             * by the PartyIdentifier.
             * - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
             * a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
             * customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
             * the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
             * - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
             * a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
             * is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
