            Definition: Unique identification, as assigned by an instructing
            party for an instructed party, to unambiguously identify the
            instruction.

            Usage: The instruction identification is a point to point reference
            that can be used between the instructing party and the instructed
            party to refer to the individual instruction. It can be included in
            several messages related to the instruction.

            Definition: Unique identification, as assigned by the initiating
            party, to unambiguously identify the transaction. This
            identification is passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire
            end-to-end chain.

            Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for reconciliation
            or to link tasks relating to the transaction. It can be included in
            several messages related to the transaction.

            Usage: In case there are technical limitations to pass on multiple
            references, the end-to-end identification must be passed on
            throughout the entire end-to-end chain.

            Usage: The transaction identification can be used for
            reconciliation, tracking or to link tasks relating to the
            transaction on the interbank level.

            Usage: The instructing agent has to make sure that the transaction
