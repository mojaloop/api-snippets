                        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.
                        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
                        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
                        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
                        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
                        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
                        international prefix.
                        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
                        participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
                        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                        PartySubIdOrType element.
                        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                        use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                        characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                        by the PartyIdentifier.
                      example: PERSONAL_ID
                    partyIdentifier:
                      title: PartyIdentifier
