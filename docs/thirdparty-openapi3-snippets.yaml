                            The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a
                            canonical format that is restricted by a regular
                            expression for interoperability reasons. This
                            pattern does not allow any trailing zeroes at all,
                            but allows an amount without a minor currency unit.
                            It also only allows four digits in the minor
                            currency unit; a negative value is not allowed.
                            Using more than 18 digits in the major currency unit
                            is not allowed.

                            [ITU-T E.164
                            standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).

                            Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single
                            plus sign, indicating the

                            international prefix.

                            - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a

                            participant. The format of the email should be
                            according to the informational

                            [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

                            - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as
                            reference to a participant.

                            Examples of personal identification are passport
                            number, birth certificate

                            number, and national registration number. The
                            identifier number is added in

                            the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier
                            type is added in the

                            PartySubIdOrType element.

                            - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an
                            organization or a company)

                            is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS
                            identifier can be in any

                            format. To make a transaction connected to a
                            specific username or bill number

                            in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should
                            be used.

                            - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or
                            ATM) ID connected to a

                            specific business or organization is used as
                            reference to a Party.

                            For referencing a specific device under a specific
                            business or organization,

                            use the PartySubIdOrType element.

                            - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account
                            ID should be used as

                            reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID
                            identifier can be in any format,

                            as formats can greatly differ depending on country
                            and FSP.

                            - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is
                            used as reference to a

                            participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up
                            to 34 alphanumeric

                            characters and should be entered without whitespace.

                            - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a
                            participant. The alias should be

                            created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an
                            account owner.

                            Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP
                            system.

                            The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is
                            also possible to use the

                            PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account
                            under an Alias defined

                            by the PartyIdentifier.

                        The API data type DateTime is a JSON String in a lexical
                        format that is restricted by a regular expression for
                        interoperability reasons. The format is according to
                        [ISO
                        8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html),
                        expressed in a combined date, time and time zone format.
                        A more readable version of the format is
                        yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS[-HH:MM]. Examples are
                        "2016-05-24T08:38:08.699-04:00",
                        "2016-05-24T08:38:08.699Z" (where Z indicates Zulu time

        is located (for example, `GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789`, or `GET

        support a query string for filtering of currency. To use filtering of
        currency, the HTTP request `GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ`
        should be used, where `XYZ` is the requested currency.

          address, as a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so
          on. Multiple `X-Forwarded-For` values should be expected and supported
          by implementers of the API.


          **Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in [RFC
          7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239). However, to this point RFC
          7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.

        Main difference being the CONSENT and THIRD_PARTY_LINK enums.


        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.

        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory

        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a
        participant.

        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the

        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).

        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating
        the

        international prefix.

        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a

        participant. The format of the email should be according to the
        informational

        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a
        participant.

        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth
        certificate

        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added
        in

        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company)

        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in
        any

        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill
        number

        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a

        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.

        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or
        organization,

        use the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as

        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any
        format,

        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a

        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric

        characters and should be entered without whitespace.

        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should
        be

        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.

        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined

        by the PartyIdentifier.

    X-Forwarded-For:
      name: X-Forwarded-For
      in: header
      schema: *ref_40
      required: false
      description: >-
        The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard
        used for informational purposes of the originating client IP address, as
        a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple
        `X-Forwarded-For` values should be expected and supported by
        implementers of the API.


        **Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in [RFC
        7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239). However, to this point RFC
        7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.
    FSPIOP-Source:
      name: FSPIOP-Source
      in: header
      schema: *ref_41
      required: true
      description: >-
        The `FSPIOP-Source` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by
        the API for identifying the sender of the HTTP request. The field should
        be set by the original sender of the request. Required for routing and
        signature verification (see header field `FSPIOP-Signature`).
    FSPIOP-Destination:
      name: FSPIOP-Destination
      in: header
      schema: *ref_42
      required: false
      description: >-
        The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used
        by the API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to
        the destination. The field must be set by the original sender of the
        request if the destination is known (valid for all services except GET
        /parties) so that any entities between the client and the server do not
        need to parse the payload for routing purposes. If the destination is
        not known (valid for service GET /parties), the field should be left
        empty.
    FSPIOP-Encryption:
      name: FSPIOP-Encryption

      schema: *ref_45
      required: false
      description: >-
        The `FSPIOP-URI` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the
        API for signature verification, should contain the service URI. Required
        if signature verification is used, for more information, see [the API
        Signature
        document](https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/tree/master/Specification%20Document%20Set).
    FSPIOP-HTTP-Method:
