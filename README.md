# api-snippets

API Snippets makes it easy to work with Mojaloop's APIs, by breaking down the definitions into reusable, composable chunks.

## Swagger UI Api Preview

https://docs.mojaloop.io/api-snippets/

## Usage

Install the snippet library
```bash
  npm install @mojaloop/api-snippets --save-dev
```

Install the reference resolving library
```bash
  npm install @redocly/openapi-cli --save-dev
```

Modify swagger file to reference `api-snippets`.

ex.
```yaml
Money:
  $ref: /path/to/node_modules/@mojaloop/api-snippets/fspiop/v1_1/openapi3/components/schemas/Money.yaml
```

Render and resolve the references.
```bash
  openapi bundle --output openapi.yaml --ext yaml openapi_template.yaml
```

Validate the result file.
```bash
  swagger-cli validate api_render.yaml
```

## Swagger-UI

The snippets specification is previewable using swagger-ui. Swagger-UI files
are found in `docs/dist/`. Github pages uses the main branch `docs/` folder
to build the page found at https://docs.mojaloop.io/api-snippets/

## Dev Tools

To create snippets the tool found at https://redoc.ly/docs/cli/#installation-and-usage
was used to break up large specification files. Some manual edits to the paths
are needed to format the files.

TODO: Add more detailed instructions for this workflow.
- `npm install -g @redocly/openapi-cli`
- `openapi split fspiop-rest-v1.1-openapi3-snippets.yaml --outDir ./fspiop/v1_1`

## Questions

1) Do we need to support both Swagger 2.0 and Open Api 3?

## Suggestions for Improvement
1) Avoid storing generated files in the repo. All artifacts should be generated during build time (when building docker image).
2) Organize snippets into folders based on their usage (i.e. bulk API, participants API, etc)  

## DTO TypeScript definitions for snippets
> [Data Transfer Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) description


The reason to have DTO is to allow separation between data transfer and data access phases.

From OpenAPI definition perspective `api-snippets` module allows building api.yaml definitions using a structured set of building blocks - `the snippets`.

From microservices implementation point of view there is a need to have similar mechanism to allow declaring aggregated api data transfer types using basic types. These basic types reflect api-snippets definitions at implementation language level of TypeScript

### Example of payload definition

Let assume we want to define a new type to represent the http request POST payload body with two properties: `requestId` and `amount` using already defined in `api-snippets` basic types: `CorrelationId` and `Money`


```typescript
import { Schemas } from '@mojaloop/api-snippets/v1_0'

interface ExampleTransferRequest {
  requestId: Schemas.CorrelationId
  amount: Schemas.Money
}
```

### structure of `@mojaloop/api-snippets` TypeScript type system module


`api-snippets` OpenAPI definitions are grouped in three sections/folders with corresponding Javascript sub-modules

| OpenApi                      | TypeScript            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| v1.0/openapi3/               | v1_0                  |
| v1.1/openapi3/               | v1_1                  |
| thirdparty/opeanapi3         | thirdparty            |


The same structure is kept in TypesScript module, but with some handy shortcuts: there are no `openapi3/schemas` sub-folders/sub-modules

To use the types defined for `CorrelationId` and `Money` snippets
- `v1.0/openapi3/schemas/CorrelationId.yaml`
- `v1.0/openapi3/schemas/Money.yaml`

You can import them in a such short way:
```typescript
import { Schemas } from `@mojaloop/api-snippets/v1_0`

interface ExampleTransferRequest {
  requestId: Schemas.CorrelationId
  amount: Schemas.Money
}
```

You can also have access to full `openapi` interface auto generated by [openapi-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript) including `paths` & `components`
```typescript
import { openapi } from `@mojaloop/api-snippets/v1_0`

interface ExampleTransferRequest {
  requestId: openapi.components['schemas']['CorrelationId']
  amount: openapi.components['schemas']['Money']
}
```

### DTO auto generation

For development of api-snippets module please use this `mantra`
```bash
npm run build
```

It will generate OpenAPI specifications from snippets, then generate DTO from these snippets and finally generate javascript code

### Auto generation for micro services
When developing a micro service, to generate interfaces from your own OpenAPI specification custom types, please use
```bash
npx openapi-typescript src/interface/api.yaml --output src/interface/openapi.ts
```

The `src/interface/api.yaml` should be final OpenAPI specification, not a template one.

`openapi -typescript` cli is installed in your system as `@mojaloop/api-snippets` dependency

By convention we are keeping micro service OpenAPI specification in `src/interface` folder
### DTO type aliasing
Type aliasing could be very handy when working with `src/interface/openapi.ts` file. Suggested pattern is to create a new file `src/interface/api.ts` and declare aliases inside:

```typescript
import { components } from './openapi.ts'

// reexport openapi if needed
export * as openapi from './openapi.ts'

// let define some aliases for schemas
export namespace Schemas {
  export type CorrelationId = components['schemas']['CorrelationId']
  export type Money = components['schemas']['Money']
  export type MyCustomRequest = components['schemas']['MyCustomRequest']
}
```

So later in you implementation code you can refer to interfaces via these aliases:

```typescript
import { Schemas } from 'src/interface/api.ts'

let request: Schemas.MyCustomRequest = { ... }
```

### DTO usage examples
please check in `src/example.ts` for further reading

### DTO linting
to lint generated files use:
```bash
npm run lint
```

the `npm run build:dto` script is already executing linting with auto-fixing

there is pre-commit hook setup witch do a linting for staged files.
### DTO testing
- testing of DTO declarations
