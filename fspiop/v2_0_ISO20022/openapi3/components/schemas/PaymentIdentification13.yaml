          Definition: Unique identification, as assigned by the initiating party, to unambiguously identify the
          transaction. This identification is passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire end-to-end chain.

          Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for reconciliation or to link tasks relating to the
          transaction. It can be included in several messages related to the transaction.

          Usage: In case there are technical limitations to pass on multiple references, the end-to-end
          identification must be passed on throughout the entire end-to-end chain.
