          InstructionIdentification (FSPIOP equivalent: transactionRequestId)

          Definition: Unique identification, as assigned by an instructing party for an instructed party, to
          unambiguously identify the instruction.

          Usage: The instruction identification is a point to point reference that can be used between the
          instructing party and the instructed party to refer to the individual instruction. It can be included in
          several messages related to the instruction.

          This field has been changed from the original ISO20022 `Max35Text`` schema to a ULIDIdentifier schema.

          EndToEndIdentification (FSPIOP equivalent: transactionId)

          Definition: Unique identification, as assigned by the initiating party, to unambiguously identify the
          transaction. This identification is passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire end-to-end chain.

          Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for reconciliation or to link tasks relating to the
          transaction. It can be included in several messages related to the transaction.

          Usage: In case there are technical limitations to pass on multiple references, the end-to-end
          identification must be passed on throughout the entire end-to-end chain.

          This field has been changed from the original ISO20022 `Max35Text`` schema to a ULIDIdentifier schema.

          transaction that is passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire interbank chain.

          Usage: The transaction identification can be used for reconciliation, tracking or to link tasks relating to
          the transaction on the interbank level.

          Usage: The instructing agent has to make sure that the transaction identification is unique for a preagreed period.

          This field has been changed from the original ISO20022 `Max35Text`` schema to a ULIDIdentifier schema.
