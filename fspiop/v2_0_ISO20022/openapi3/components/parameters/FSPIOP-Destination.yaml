description: >-
  The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the
  API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to the
  destination. The field must be set by the original sender of the request if
  the destination is known (valid for all services except GET /parties) so that
  any entities between the client and the server do not need to parse the
  payload for routing purposes. If the destination is not known (valid for
  service GET /parties), the field should be left empty.
