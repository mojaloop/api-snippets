  The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard used
  for informational purposes of the originating client IP address, as a request
  might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple `X-Forwarded-For`
  values should be expected and supported by implementers of the API.


  **Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in [RFC
  7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239). However, to this point RFC 7239 is
  less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.
