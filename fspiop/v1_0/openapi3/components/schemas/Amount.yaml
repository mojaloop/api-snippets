description: >-
  The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is
  restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons. This pattern
  does not allow any trailing zeroes at all, but allows an amount without a
  minor currency unit. It also only allows four digits in the minor currency
  unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits in the major
  currency unit is not allowed.
