    If the server is unable to find or create a transfer, or another processing
    error occurs, the error callback `PUT /transfers/{ID}/error` is used. The
    `{ID}` in the URI should contain the `transferId` that was used for the
    creation of the transfer, or the `{ID}` that was used in the `GET
    /transfers/{ID}`.
