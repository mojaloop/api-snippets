  The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by
  the API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to the
  destination. The field should be set by the original sender of the request
  (if known), so that any entities between the client and the server do not
  need to parse the payload for routing purposes.
