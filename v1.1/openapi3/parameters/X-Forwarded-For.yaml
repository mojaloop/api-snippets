description: |
  The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard used
  for informational purposes of the originating client IP address, as a
  request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple
  `X-Forwarded-For` values should be expected and supported by implementers
  of the API.
  **Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in
  [RFC 7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239).
  However, to this point RFC 7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.
