title: Amount
type: string
pattern: '^([0]|([1-9][0-9]{0,17}))([.][0-9]{0,3}[1-9])?$'
description: |
  The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is
  restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons.
  This pattern does not allow any trailing zeroes at all, but allows an amount
  without a minor currency unit. It also only allows four digits in the minor
  currency unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits
  in the major currency unit is not allowed.
example: 123.45
