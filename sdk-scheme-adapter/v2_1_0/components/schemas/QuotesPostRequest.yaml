            An optional field which will allow the payer DFSP to specify which DFSP it wants to undertake currency conversion.
            This is useful incase of if the sender wants the recipient to receive a specified amount of the target currency,
            but the payer DFSP does not want to undertake the currency conversion. In this case, the amount of the transfer
            would be expressed in the target currency and the amountType would be set to RECEIVE.
