  description: |
    The HTTP request `PUT /thirdpartyRequests/authorizations/{ID}/error` is used by the DFSP or PISP to inform
    the other party that something went wrong with a Thirdparty Transaction Authorization Request.

    The PISP may use this to tell the DFSP that the Thirdparty Transaction Authorization Request is invalid or doesn't
    match a `transactionRequestId`.

    The DFSP may use this to tell the PISP that the signed challenge returned in `PUT /thirdpartyRequest/authorizations/{ID}`
    was invalid.
