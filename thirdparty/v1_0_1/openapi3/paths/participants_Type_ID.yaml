    The HTTP request `GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}` (or `GET
    /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}`) is used to find out in which FSP the
    requested Party, defined by `{Type}`, `{ID}` and optionally `{SubId}`, is
    located (for example, `GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789`, or `GET
    /participants/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1`). This HTTP request should
    support a query string for filtering of currency. To use filtering of
    currency, the HTTP request `GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ`
    should be used, where `XYZ` is the requested currency.

    The callback `PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}` (or `PUT

    successful result of the lookup, creation, or deletion of the FSP
    information related to the Party. If the FSP information is deleted, the
    fspId element should be empty; otherwise the element should include the FSP
    information for the Party.

    The HTTP request `DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}` (or `DELETE
    /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}`) is used to delete information in the
    server regarding the provided identity, defined by `{Type}` and `{ID}`) (for
    example, `DELETE /participants/MSISDN/123456789`), and optionally `{SubId}`.
    This HTTP request should support a query string to delete FSP information
    regarding a specific currency only. To delete a specific currency only, the
    HTTP request `DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ` should be used,
    where `XYZ` is the requested currency.


    **Note:** The Account Lookup System should verify that it is the Party’s
    current FSP that is deleting the FSP information.
