    Used by PISP, DFSP

    The **DELETE /consents/**_{ID}_ request is used to request the revocation of a previously agreed consent.
    For tracing and auditing purposes, the switch should be sure not to delete the consent physically;
    instead, information relating to the consent should be marked as deleted and requests relating to the
    consent should not be honoured.
