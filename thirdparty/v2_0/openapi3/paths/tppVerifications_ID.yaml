    The HTTP request `PUT /tppVerifications/{ID}` is used by the Auth-Service to inform
    the DFSP of a successful result in validating the verification of a Thirdparty Transaction Request.

    If the validation fails, the auth-service will send back `PUT /tppVerifications/{ID}`
    with `authenticationResponse: 'REJECTED'`.

    In unplanned error cases the Auth-Service MUST use `PUT /tppVerifications/{ID}/error`.
