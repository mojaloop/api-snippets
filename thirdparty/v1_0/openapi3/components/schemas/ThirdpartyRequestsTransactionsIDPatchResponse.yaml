  Used by: DFSP

  The issuing PISP will expect a response to their request for a transfer
  which describes the finalized state of the requested transfer.

  This response will be given by a PATCH call on the
  /thirdpartyRequests/transactions/{ID} resource.

  The {ID} given in the query string should be the transactionRequestId which
  was originally used by the PISP to identify the transaction request.
