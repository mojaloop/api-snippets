title: AccountAddress
type: string
description: >-
  The AccountAddress data type is a variable length string with a maximum size
  of 1023 characters and consists of:

  Alphanumeric characters, upper or lower case. (Addresses are case-sensitive
  so that they can contain data encoded in formats such as base64url.)

  - Underscore (_)
  - Tilde (~)
  - Hyphen (-)
  - Period (.) Addresses MUST NOT end in a period (.) character

  An entity providing accounts to parties (i.e. a participant) can provide any
  value for an AccountAddress that is meaningful to that entity.
  It does not need to provide an address that makes the account identifiable
  outside the entity's domain.

  IMPORTANT: The policy for defining addresses and the life-cycle of these is at the discretion of the address space owner (the payer DFSP in this case).
