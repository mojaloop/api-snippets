    The HTTP request `GET /consentRequests/{ID}` is used to get information about a previously 
    requested consent. The *{ID}* in the URI should contain the consentRequestId that was assigned to the 
    request by the PISP when the PISP originated the request.

  summary: UpdateConsentRequest
  description: |
    A DFSP uses this callback to (1) inform the PISP that the consentRequest has been accepted, 
    and (2) communicate to the PISP which `authChannel` it should use to authenticate their user
    with.

    When a PISP requests a series of permissions from a DFSP on behalf of a DFSP’s customer, not all 
    the permissions requested may be granted by the DFSP. Conversely, the out-of-band authorization 
    process  may result in additional privileges being granted by the account holder to the PISP. The
    **PUT /consentRequests/**_{ID}_ resource returns the current state of the permissions relating to a 
    particular authorization request.
