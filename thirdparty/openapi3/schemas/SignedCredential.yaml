title: SignedCredential
type: object
description: |
  A credential used to allow a user to prove their identity and access
  to an account with a DFSP.

  SignedCredential is a special formatting of the credential to allow us to be
  more explicit about the `status` field - it should only ever be PENDING when updating
  a credential.
