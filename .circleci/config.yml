# CircleCI configuration using the mojaloop/build orb
# This streamlined config replaces 500+ lines with the power of the mojaloop/build orb
# The orb provides standardized build, test, and release workflows for Mojaloop projects
#
# The orb automatically handles:
# - PR title checking
# - Dependency installation and caching
# - Linting
# - Unit, integration, and functional testing
# - Vulnerability checking (npm audit)
# - License scanning
# - Grype security scanning (NEW: source code scanning for this library)
# - Automated releases to npm and GitHub
# - Slack notifications
#
# To enable this configuration:
# 1. Go to CircleCI project settings â†’ Advanced
# 2. Enable "Enable dynamic config using setup workflows"
