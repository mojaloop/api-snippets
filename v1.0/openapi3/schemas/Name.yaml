title: Name
type: string
pattern: '^(?!\s*$)[\w .,''-]{1,128}$'

  The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular expression
  to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.
  Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the
  Name type is \"^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,'-]{1,128}$\". The restriction does not
  allow a string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode characters are
  allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe (â€˜), dash (-), comma (,)
  and space characters ( ).
  **Note:** In some programming languages,
  Unicode support must be specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used,
  the flag UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.
